# Common Descriptions for Computational Resources

The Computational Resource Description (CRD) is an attempt to create uniform semantics for describing computational resources. 

[Science Gateways Community Institute](https://sciencegateways.org/) will champion this effort with contributions from the Cyberinfrastructure community at large.

# Description Format

We will evaluate JSON/YAML and Protocol Buffers to experiment a suitable programming language neutral descriptions. 

The `playground` folder will include these examples.
